Objective:
Using python algorithms to highlight the time periods where this abnormality can be
observed.
About the data:
There are 6 variables and 370k records. Data is recorded once every 5 minutes over a duration of 3 years.
1. Cyclone_Inlet_Gas_Temp – Temperature of Hot gas entering the cyclone.
2. Cyclone_Gas_Outlet_Temp – Temperature of Hot gas leaving the cyclone.
3. Cyclone_Outlet_Gas_draft – Draft (pressure) of gas at outlet of cyclone.
4. Cyclone_cone_draft – Draft (pressure) of gas at cone section of cyclone.
5. Cyclone_Inlet_Draft – Draft (pressure) of gas at inlet of cyclo
ne.
6. Cyclone_Material_Temp – Temperature of the material at the outlet of the cyclone.
   
Output:
Insights – Time Series Analysis to detect the abnormalities and find the abnormal periods.
